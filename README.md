# Intellij Golang Linter Inspection Plugin

Write code, write better code

All credit goes to [GolangCI-Lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).

A lot of code pieces copied from [clion-clangtidy](https://bitbucket.org/baldur/clion-clangtidy/src/default/), [kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin), and [Goland plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9568-go) itself.

## What's next
* Fix bugs (a lot bugs...)
* Test on Windows (I'm developing on Mac, linux should be OK)
* Write test cases

Thanks guys. I finally got some free time and I plan to publish this plugin to alpha testing phase in 1 week. Really appreciated your feedbacks, please report issue here if you run into any trouble. Please kindly note down your platform (windows/linux/mac) and Go version, and necessary steps (if any) to reproduce the bug, so that I could quickly identify the problem. Hope the plugin could be stablized before Dec.
