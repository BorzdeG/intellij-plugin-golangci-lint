# Intellij Golang Linter Inspection Plugin

Write code, write better code

All credit goes to [GolangCI-Lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).

A lot of code pieces copied from [clion-clangtidy](https://bitbucket.org/baldur/clion-clangtidy/src/default/), [kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin), and [Goland plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9568-go) itself.

## Report a bug
* Please note down your platform (Win/Linux/Mac), IDEA/Goland version, Go version
* If the plugin reports an error, please copy-paste the error content

## What's next
* Fix bugs (a lot bugs...)
* Test on Windows (I'm developing on Mac, linux should be OK)
* Write test cases

####
Finally got some time because of the quarantine of current coronavirus break. I swear I'll start beta test this week.
